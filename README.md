## Abstract:

<p align="justify">Right in the middle of Operations Research and Graph Theory, this project consists of implementing <i><b>Dijkstra & Sedgewick-Vitter</b></i> algorithms to produce shortest-path trees for all nodes of a directed graph. These algorithms are part of the larger class of Graph and tree search algorithms, with a <b>wide range of applications</b> from graph optimization to network routing protocols, all the way to distributed computing.</p>

## Repository Assets:

- [Code](CODE/)
- [Data](DATA/)

## Business Context:

<p align="justify">One of the very first steps in Data Science and Optimization projects is <i>data preparation</i>. More often than not, data could be stored or modeled as a graph or a tree. In this context, it is essential to prepare and store the data in the right data structures, and this might involve pre-processing the data. For the purpose of finding the shortest-path between all nodes of a directed graph, known as the shortest-path trees, Dijkstra's algorithm is required.</p>

## Problem Description:

<p align="justify">This project focuses on an in-depth study of the Dijkstra algorithm and its variant, the Sedgewick-Vitter algorithm. It includes the implementation of these algorithms to work with geographical data from the ROUTE 500 database provided by the Institut GÃ©ographique National (IGN).</p>
